## Brainstorm
Idea: A watch shaped device to be worn when outdoors that monitors UV light exposure and informs user on the risk of sunburn. The device notifies the user if s/he needs to reapply sunblock or if s/he is not getting enough sunlight. Notification might be relayed with vibration or small LED display. Lights can change color and/or glow more brightly with increasing UV exposure. Might need a reset button if switching to a different user/new day (can reset UV light accumulation automatically after night). Possible additions will include taking user's skin color into account when assessing risk of sunburn.

## Abstract
Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the US and rates have been increasing for the past 30 years. The primary risk factor for skin cancer is exposure to UV light from the sun and tanning beds. Although preventative steps such as reducing sun exposure and application of sufficient sunscreen are known, adherence is not very good. To increase people's awareness of skin cancer and provide them a gentle reminder to reduce their risk (by either reducing UV exposure or applying sunscreen), we propose a wearable UV sensing device that monitors a wearer's UV light exposure and provides a visible and/or audible signal when the UV exposure reaches dangerous limits. The watch shaped device will be worn throughout the day and take continuous measurements of the wearer's UV exposure and keep a running accumulation. The recommended daily limits of UVA and UVB light from recognized international dermatological societies will be used as limits. The number of glowing LED lights on the wearable will increase as the accumulated UV light exposure increases. As the recommended limit is approached or reached, the LEDs will blink, an alarm will sound and the  device will vibrate. There will be a reset button if the device is switched to a different user. The running daily total will automatically reset each night. The housing will be designed in solid-works and 3-d printed to accommodate the Arduino based microcontroller and battery and hold the UV sensor in place. Future advances might include an LED display to give a numerical readout of the current and accumulated total of UV exposure. Another possible addition to be considered for future inclusion will be measuring a user's skin color and estimating melanin content to adjust the daily UV limits and/or risk of sunburn.
