## Brainstorm
Idea: A watch shaped device to be worn when outdoors that monitors UV light exposure and informs user on the risk of sunburn. The device notifies the user if s/he needs to reapply sunblock or if s/he is not getting enough sunlight. Notification might be relayed with vibration or small LED display. Lights can change color and/or glow more brightly with increasing UV exposure. Might need a reset button if switching to a different user/new day (can reset UV light accumulation automatically after night). Possible additions will include taking user's skin color into account when assessing risk of sunburn.
